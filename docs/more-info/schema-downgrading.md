# Schema Downgrading

Schema Downgrading is not an offical part of DbUp. Because it's error prone and hard to implement properly. See Discussion [https://github.com/DbUp/DbUp/issues/42](https://github.com/DbUp/DbUp/issues/42)

If you need the functionality anyway? Take a look at the extension [https://github.com/asimeonov/DbUp.Downgrade/](https://github.com/asimeonov/DbUp.Downgrade/).
