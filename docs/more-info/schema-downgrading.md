# Schema Downgrading

Schema downgrading is not implemented in DbUp because it's error prone and hard to implement properly. See related [discussion](https://github.com/DbUp/DbUp/issues/42).

If you need this functionality anyway, please take a look at the [DbUp.Downgrade](https://github.com/asimeonov/DbUp.Downgrade) project.
